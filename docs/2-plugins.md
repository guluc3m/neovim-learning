# Step 2: Plugins

We recomend using the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager.

Some plugins we recomend are:
- [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): Fuzzy search files with previews.
- [coq](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim): Autocompletion.
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua): File viewer.
