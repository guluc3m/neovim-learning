# Step 2: Plugins

## Package manager
We recomend using the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager.


## Plugins
We recomend looking through plugins and slowly integrating them if you think it will benefit your workflow/experience.  
As with most things, it's often better to slowly build your tools as you adquire new knowledge than entering nvim blindly with a bunch of plugins you don't know how to use (looking at you, [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)).

Here are some of our recomendations:

### Ease of use
- [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary): Easy commenting/uncommenting.
- [todo-comments.nvim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim): Browse TODOs, FIXMEs, etc.
- [which-key.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim): Shows possible key bindings (when needed; configurable)

### Files
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): Fuzzy search files (with previews!).
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua): File viewer.
